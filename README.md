# Analog and Digital Circuit Design Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Analog and Digital Circuit Design repository! This project focuses on the fundamental design of analog and digital circuits, utilizing CMOS technology and various gate implementations. The repository includes both circuit schematics and their corresponding Verilog codes. The design is based on the SkyWater Sky130 Process Design Kit (PDK), and the circuits are simulated using XSCHEM and NGSPICE software.

## Contents

1. **Circuit Designs:**
   - Analog Circuits: Schematics and Verilog code for various analog circuit components.
   - Digital Circuits: Implementation of digital gates and circuits using CMOS technology.

2. **Sky130 PDK:**
   - The project extensively employs the SkyWater Sky130 PDK for the CMOS technology node.

3. **XSCHEM:**
   - Circuit schematics are created using XSCHEM, a powerful open-source schematic capture tool.

4. **NGSPICE:**
   - NGSPICE is utilized for circuit simulation, enabling a thorough analysis of circuit performance.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure that you have the Sky130 PDK installed and configured.
   - Install XSCHEM and NGSPICE on your system.
